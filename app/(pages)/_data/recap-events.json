        "description": "The 16th Annual Empty Bowls event took place on October 23, 2024, at Life Pointe Church in Woodland, uniting the community in a global effort to combat local hunger. This year’s gathering featured 12 delicious soups served by community leaders and local dignitaries, along with a vibrant raffle offering unique prizes. Together, we came close to reaching our ambitious $35,000 fundraising goal.\nEvery dollar raised directly supports Fourth & Hope’s emergency shelter program, which helps Yolo County residents move from the streets to stability. Beyond providing shelter, we offer a pathway to renewed life and hope.\nMore than just a fundraiser, Empty Bowls showcased the compassion and generosity of our community, demonstrating a collective commitment to helping those in need.",
